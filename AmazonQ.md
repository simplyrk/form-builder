# Build Error Fixes by Amazon Q

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Document Configuration
The build was failing with the error: `PageNotFoundError: Cannot find module for page: /_document`

**Solution:**
Created the necessary files in the Pages Router format to support the App Router:
- Created `/src/pages/_document.tsx` with basic HTML structure
- Created `/src/pages/_app.tsx` with basic App component
- Created `/src/pages/404.tsx` that redirects to the App Router's not-found page
- Created `/src/pages/_error.tsx` for error handling

### 2. Type Error in forms-layout.tsx
The build was failing with: `Type error: 'pathname' is possibly 'null'`

**Solution:**
Added a null check for the pathname variable:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Extract form id from url if exists
  if (pathname) {
    const match = pathname.match(/\/forms\/([a-zA-Z0-9-_]+)/);
    if (match) {
      setCurrentFormId(match[1]);
    } else {
      setCurrentFormId(null);
    }
  }
}, [pathname]);
```

## Build Results

The build is now successful with:
- 24 routes in the App Router
- 2 routes in the Pages Router
- Middleware successfully compiled

There are still some ESLint warnings about import ordering in a few files, but these don't affect the build:
- `src/components/form-field.tsx`
- `src/components/response-edit-form.tsx`
- `src/pages/404.tsx`

These can be addressed later if needed.
