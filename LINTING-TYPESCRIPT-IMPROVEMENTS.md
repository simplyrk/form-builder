# Linting and TypeScript Improvements

This document outlines the linting and TypeScript improvements that have been made to the Cursor CRM codebase.

## 1. ESLint Configuration Enhancements

### What's been improved:
- Added more comprehensive ESLint rules for better code quality
- Implemented plugins for import organization, accessibility, and TypeScript
- Created a more structured configuration in `.eslintrc.json` and `eslint.config.mjs`
- Added a `.eslintignore` file to exclude specific files from linting

### How to use:
- Run `npm run lint` to check the codebase for linting issues
- Many import ordering issues can be fixed automatically using our new script:
  ```
  node scripts/fix-imports.js
  ```
- Address other linting warnings incrementally
  
## 2. TypeScript Configuration Improvements

### What's been improved:
- Maintained strict mode typing
- Added safer switch statement checking with `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`
- Added detection of unreachable code and unused labels
- Prepared configuration for future stricter type checking

### How to use:
- Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to check the codebase for TypeScript issues
- Fix TypeScript errors incrementally, focusing on critical errors first
- When ready for more strict checks, uncomment additional rules in `tsconfig.json`

## 3. New Tools and Scripts

### fix-imports.js
This script automates fixing import order issues:
- Processes TypeScript files in batches
- Uses ESLint's autofix capabilities
- Generates a summary of fixes and any errors

To use:
```
node scripts/fix-imports.js
```

## 4. Recommended Next Steps

1. Run the fix-imports.js script to address import ordering issues
2. Fix the most critical TypeScript errors:
   - Missing 'Field' type in @/types/form
   - Incorrect function parameter types
   - Type mismatches in form submission
3. Gradually enable more strict TypeScript checks as issues are resolved
4. Add pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality standards
5. Consider implementing a CI/CD pipeline for automated code quality checks

## 5. Long-term Recommendations

- Standardize authentication routes
- Group related components into logical subdirectories
- Convert remaining test files to use ES modules instead of CommonJS
- Add more comprehensive test coverage
- Consider end-to-end testing with Playwright or Cypress
