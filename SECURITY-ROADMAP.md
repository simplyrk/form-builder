# Security Roadmap

This document outlines planned security improvements for the Cursor CRM project, prioritized by impact and implementation effort.

## Implementation Notes

### Running the Server with Security Features

The security features implemented in this roadmap are automatically applied when running the standard Next.js server:

```bash
# Development mode with security headers
npm run dev

# Production build and run with security headers
npm run build
npm start
```

No additional commands or configuration is needed as the security features are implemented as Next.js middleware, which is automatically loaded when the server starts.

## High Priority (Immediate)

1. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)** - IMPLEMENTED
   - Add CSP headers to protect against XSS attacks
   - Define allowed sources for scripts, styles, images, and connections
   - Implementation: src/middleware.ts
   - Status: Completed

2. **Enable Helmet Security Headers** - IMPLEMENTED
   - Add security headers using Next.js middleware (src/middleware-helmet.ts)
   - Implement headers for XSS protection, clickjacking prevention, and MIME type security
   - Added Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) with a 2-year duration
   - Implementation: src/middleware-helmet.ts
   - Status: Completed

3. **Improve File Upload Security** - IMPLEMENTED
   - Move uploads outside public directory to secure storage location
   - Implement server-side MIME type validation with file signature verification
   - Add virus/malware scanning with content-based detection
   - Implementation: src/lib/file-upload.ts, src/lib/file-scanner.ts
   - Status: Completed

## Medium Priority (Next 30 Days)
